Alt finder on wow

namestotext.py - Type realm and guild, it will put names in guild_memberx.txt
altfinder.py - using api it will request pet data, convert them to hash and compare with all other characters from names.txt, then gives same account ID to those who have same pet data (one actual account)
uploade database.py - login to FTP on webiste, convert database file to text file (Much smaller file), and uploads on the ftp
then I have provided index.php with styles.css as webside, that shows the characters under accounts in readable way

All text files have some characters for example.
You can check how the website looks on my own website with all of this
